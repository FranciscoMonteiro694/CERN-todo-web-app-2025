This is a skeleton of Spring Boot application which should be used as a start point to create a working one.
The goal of this task is to create simple REST API  which allows users to manage TODOs. 
The API should allow to create/delete/update TODOs and categories as well as search for user, name, description, deadline and category in any combination. *For example find all todos for an user X where deadline is today and name contains test.* 
The API should also implement basic authorization/authentication. *User X cannot access TODOs of user Y as long as he doesn't have admin role.*

Below you may find a proposition of the DB model:

To complete the exercise please implement all missing classes and functionalities in order to be able to store and retrieve information about tasks and their categories.
Once you are ready, please send it to me (ie link to your git repository) before  our interview.
